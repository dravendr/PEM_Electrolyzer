The machine learning code file was written in jupyter notebook and saved in the corresponding format of .ipynb. To run the code, we suggest users to install Anaconda 3 in windows 10 and install the following necessary python packages with the same or higher version to set up compatible environment: Python 3.7; jupyter 1.0.0; numpy 1.20.2; pandas 1.0.1; scikit-learn 0.22.1; matplotlib 3.1.3; shap 0.39.0；seaborn 0.10.0; tensorflow-gpu 2.4.1; tensorflow-estimator 2.4.0; Keras 2.4.3; keras-metrics 1.1.0; catboost 0.23.2; lightgbm 3.2.1; xgboost 1.0.2. For training the ANN models, two GPU of GTX 2080ti equipped with i9 9900k was used. For other 8 machine learning algorithms, the models were trained on a computing cluster which has been clarified in the “Funding Source” part.
